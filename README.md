Grocery Delivery is developed and designed for low income earners
Need a team to assist in getting this project up and going.

Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm a African American women, Divorced, Disabled Mother of Six. My children and I deliver over 200 lb of food on a weekly basis to food desert, homeless encampment, nicholasville, several public schools.
I really need your help to get this project up and running within the next two weeks.
This project would definitely help out in several communities, it will help out several mothers/women, Youth, Seniors citizens that have hardships due to the pandemic.
My family we has taken several hits due to this pandemic, from the internet with the kids at home, loss of job wages. This project will also help save my children's lives from being human trafficked, drugs, Gangs, the streets.

Please help me to help others because I know there is someone's out there who needs help just as I do.

Thank you for your time and consideration!!
